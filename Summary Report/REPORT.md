## 🎙️ Dashboard Walkthrough – Product Performance Overview

---

### 👋 Introduction
*"Hi, let me walk you through my Power BI dashboard titled **‘Product Performance Overview’**, which is part of a broader analysis I did for a retail brand — in this case, modeled around Walmart."*

---

### 🧊 Intro & Purpose
*"The goal of this dashboard is to provide a quick yet insightful view into the company's overall product performance — covering inventory status, pricing trends, product ratings, and customer engagement."*

---

### 📊 Key KPI Cards

*"At the top, I’ve summarized four core KPIs to give immediate business context:"*

- 🧮 **Total Products**: We have nearly **30,000** unique products tracked.  
- 📦 **Products in Stock**: Over **26,000** are currently available, indicating a healthy inventory coverage of about **88%** — though it also flags over **3,600** products as out-of-stock, which could signal **lost sales** or **supply chain delays**.  
- 💰 **Average Price**: At **$76.74**, this suggests the pricing leans toward **mid-range** — appealing to both **budget-conscious** and **premium** customers.  
- ⭐ **Average Rating**: A **3.86-star** average shows that customer sentiment is decent, but not optimal. There’s opportunity to **improve quality or service** in certain areas.  

---

### 📈 Visual Insights

- *"On the **left**, I’ve included an **inventory status donut chart**, helping us visualize the in-stock vs. out-of-stock percentage — a great way to quickly assess product availability."*

- *"Below that, there’s a **table summarizing product stats by manufacturer** — showing % in stock, average price, and average rating. For instance, **Apple** and **Samsung** have high availability and strong brand presence, but brands like **The Clorox Company** have much lower in-stock rates, which could point to **fulfillment issues**."*

- *"On the **right-hand side**, there’s a **bar chart showing top products based on customer review counts**. This tells us which SKUs are driving the most engagement — **VIZIO TVs** and **Clorox products** are clearly customer favorites, which could guide **marketing** or **bundling strategies**."*

---

### 🧠 Actionable Insights

- *"If I were in a business role, I’d immediately investigate why some **high-performing products are out of stock** — since that directly affects **revenue** and **customer loyalty**."*

- *"Additionally, I’d **drill into ratings below 4.0** to isolate what’s hurting customer experience — whether it’s **product quality**, **delivery issues**, or **poor fit/expectations**."*

---

### 🎯 Why It Stands Out

*"I designed this dashboard to be **visually clean and accessible**, with **recruiter-friendly colors** and a focus on **high-impact business KPIs**. All visuals are interactive, enabling **drill-downs** based on stock status, ratings, or time period."*

---

### ✅ Close

*"This is just **one page** out of a **multi-tab report** that also includes **customer behavior** and **stock loss analysis**. Happy to walk you through the other tabs and show you the backend."*

---


## 🎙️ Walkthrough Script – Customer & Marketing Insights Page

---

### 👋 Introduction  
*"Let’s now move to the second page of my Power BI report — titled **Customer & Marketing Insights**. The purpose of this page is to explore how customers are interacting with products, how satisfied they are, and where the marketing focus should shift."*

---

### 📊 Top-Level KPIs  
*"Here at the top, I’ve highlighted key metrics that tell the story of customer engagement:"*

- 💬 **314K Total Reviews** – Reflects a strong volume of customer feedback and indicates **high product visibility**.  
- 🏆 **Zyooh** – Identified as both the **most rated** and **most reviewed** product, suggesting it's either a **marketing flagship** or a **high-interest item**.  
- ⚠️ **21K Low-Rated Products** – A red flag. This signals that a significant number of products may be **hurting brand perception** and need to be **investigated or improved**.  

---

### 📈 Memory Size vs Satisfaction  
*"On the left-hand side, I’ve broken down customer satisfaction by **memory size**. Interestingly, **6 GB** and **512 GB** variants score the highest, while **64 GB** and **16 GB** surprisingly score lower — suggesting **pricing or performance expectations** aren’t being met."*

---

### ⭐ Customer Ratings Breakdown  
*"This stacked bar chart shows **rating distribution by brand**. **VIZIO** clearly dominates with a high number of 4- and 5-star reviews. **The Clorox Company** and **Honeywell** also rank well, while brands like **Garmin** barely register — possibly due to **low exposure** or **underperformance**."*

---

### 💬 Talked About or Trusted? (Reviews vs Ratings)  
*"This scatterplot compares the **number of reviews** with **average ratings** — helping us identify products that are both **popular and trusted**. Some products with high review counts have **low ratings**, which signals a **marketing challenge**: strong attention, weak satisfaction. These are perfect candidates for **quality improvement** or **expectation realignment**."*

---

### ⚖️ Stock Pressure vs Consumer Demand  
*"This bar chart compares **review volumes between in-stock and out-of-stock items**. The out-of-stock products are getting much more attention — a classic **stock-out risk**. These are **high-demand items** that we’re potentially **losing sales** on. This helps align **demand forecasting** with **supply chain performance**."*

---

### 🧠 Actionable Insights  

- *Prioritize investigating the **21,000 low-rated products**. Run **sentiment analysis** to identify major pain points.*  
- *Collaborate with **inventory and fulfillment teams** to restock **highly-reviewed but unavailable** items faster.*  
- *Re-target **underperforming memory sizes** with either **pricing strategies** or clearer customer **expectation management**.*  

---

### 🧱 Why This Page Adds Value  
*"What sets this dashboard apart is how it **blends customer feedback with operational data** — enabling action from both ends: improving **product satisfaction** and ensuring **supply readiness**."*

---

### ✅ Wrap-Up  
*"This **customer insights page** provides a **critical lens** into **demand**, **satisfaction**, and **potential risks**. It's also fully **filterable** by stock, ratings, and time — giving decision-makers the flexibility to drill down into whatever segment they care about most."*


## 🎙️ Walkthrough Script – Stock Risk & Revenue Impact Page

---

### 👋 Introduction  
*"The third and final page of this report focuses on the **financial and operational risks** caused by stock shortages. It ties together **inventory management** and **revenue protection** — helping decision-makers understand what’s at stake when **demand outpaces supply**."*

---

### 📊 Key KPI Cards  
*"Up top, we have four critical KPIs that guide this view:"*

- ❗ **12.3% Out of Stock** – Roughly **1 in every 8 products** is unavailable, which presents a **major operational and sales risk**.  
- 📦 **26,255 Products in Stock** – Reflects overall availability, consistent with earlier pages.  
- 🚫 **3,669 Products Out of Stock** – A significant count, especially when cross-referenced with **top-performing items**.  
- 🍎 **Apple as Top OOS Manufacturer** – Apple has the **most out-of-stock items**, which is critical given its **demand level** and **profit margins**.  

---


### 🏭 Inventory Balance Across Manufacturers  
*"This bar chart compares **in-stock vs. out-of-stock counts by manufacturer**. Apple leads in both stocked and missing inventory, showing it's a **key player** but possibly strained on the **logistics or production side**."*

### 🚨 Top 10 In-Demand Products That Are Out of Stock  
*"Here’s where the risk becomes visible — **top-reviewed, high-interest products** like **Clorox disinfectants** and **Samsung TVs** are out of stock. This means we’re **missing revenue** where **demand already exists**."*

### 📉 Top 5 Manufacturers by Lost Revenue  
*"This table estimates **lost revenue** based on out-of-stock rates. **Apple** tops the list with over **$36,000** in estimated loss, followed by **Nintendo** and **Samsung**. These figures help **prioritize vendor management** and **replenishment urgency**."*

### 🔁 Top 5 Manufacturers Behind Stock Shortages  
*"This donut chart visualizes the **top contributors to shortages**. Apple, **Finite**, and **Anself** have the largest gaps. Businesses can use this to **shift procurement strategies** or **renegotiate SLAs** with suppliers."*

### ⚠️ Top Rated Product Risk Breakdown  
*"This matrix shows how **well-rated products** are being impacted by stockouts. Shockingly, **3,666** of the **4-star rated products** are out of stock — a massive **opportunity cost** since these are items customers **already love**."*

---

### 🧠 Actionable Recommendations  

- *Develop a **forecast model** based on **review volume**, **rating trends**, and **past sell-through** to **predict stockouts** before they happen.*  
- *Use **lost revenue metrics** to highlight the **cost of inaction**, guiding **inventory investment** and **supplier performance reviews**.*  

---

### ⚡ Why This Page Matters  
*"Most dashboards stop at performance. This page goes further — it **quantifies risk** and **exposes revenue leaks**. That makes it **strategic**, especially for **CFOs**, **category managers**, and **operations leaders**."*

---

### ✅ Wrap-Up  
*"This concludes the **3-page dashboard**. Each tab offers a different lens: **product performance**, **customer behavior**, and **operational risk**. Combined, they empower businesses to take **informed**, **proactive action**."*
